// Your job is to implement the entire filesearchshell.cc
// functionality. We're essentially giving you a blank screen to work
// with; you need to figure out an appropriate design, to decompose
// the problem into multiple functions or classes if that will help,
// to pick good interfaces to those functions/classes, and to make
// sure that you don't leak any memory.
//
// Here are the requirements for a working solution:
//
// The user must be able to run the program using a command like:
//
//   ./filesearchshell ./foo.idx ./bar/baz.idx /tmp/blah.idx [etc]
//
// i.e., to pass a set of filenames of indices as command line
// arguments. Then, your program needs to implement a loop where
// each loop iteration it:
//
//  (a) prints to the console a prompt telling the user to input the
//      next query.
//
//  (b) reads a white-space separated list of query words from
//      std::cin, converts them to lowercase, and constructs
//      a vector of c++ strings out of them.
//
//  (c) uses QueryProcessor.cc/.h's QueryProcessor class to
//      process the query against the indices and get back a set of
//      query results.  Note that you should instantiate a single
//      QueryProcessor  object for the lifetime of the program, rather
//      than  instantiating a new one for every query.
//
//  (d) print the query results to std::cout in the format shown in
//      the transcript on the hw3 web page.
//
// Also, you're required to quit out of the loop when std::cin
// experiences EOF, which a user passes by pressing "control-D"
// on the console.  As well, users should be able to type in an
// arbitrarily long query -- you shouldn't assume anything about
// a maximum line length.  Finally, when you break out of the
// loop and quit the program, you need to make sure you deallocate
// all dynamically allocated memory.  We will be running valgrind
// on your filesearchshell implementation to verify there are no
// leaks or errors.
//
// You might find the following technique useful, but you aren't
// required to use it if you have a different way of getting the
// job done.  To split a std::string into a vector of words, you
// can use a std::stringstream to get the job done and the ">>"
// operator. See, for example, "gnomed"'s post on stackoverflow for
// their example on how to do this:
//
//   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/236129/c-how-to-split-a-string
//
// (Search for "gnomed" on that page. They use an istringstream, but
// a stringstream gets the job done too.)
//
// Good luck, and write beautiful code!
